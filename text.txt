"Dear [Recipient's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to discuss a matter concerning my current lease agreement for the residence at 2D. As you may know, I graduated in December 2023, and I am now in the process of relocating from St. Louis. During my tenancy, Pravallika and I were both named on the lease.

As I am moving to a new city, I will need to enter into a lease agreement there. Therefore, I kindly request the removal of my name from our current lease at 2D. Pravallika intends to continue residing in the apartment until the lease term concludes. This adjustment would greatly assist me in facilitating my move and ensuring a smooth transition.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I am available to discuss this further and provide any necessary documentation to facilitate the process.
